# CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION_-_CHURN_PREDICTION

The goal is to provide a preference-based user experience at a cohort/group level.

For example, a particular affluent set of users are likely to buy premium brand products, so by using EDA, Model building, Model evaluation for customer segmentation and methods like data cleaning, data processing and model building for Churn Prediction, I have filtered and pointed out the relevant brands for their homepage which would be beneficial.
